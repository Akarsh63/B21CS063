Answer 12: The process states in XV6 are UNUSED, EMBRYO, SLEEPING, RUNNABLE, RUNNING, ZOMBIE. Unused(not in use), Embryo(being initialized), Running(actively executing), Runnable process is which it is ready to execute, Sleeping process is which it is waiting for an event to occur and the zombie process is the one which is already terminated but it still have an entry in the process table.

Answer 13: The file structure have the key components as inode table,data block,super block. Indode table is resposible for storing metadata, Data block role is to store file content, and superblock contains key file system information.

Answer 14: System calls are interfaces between user programs and the operating system, providing services like file I/O and process control. Library functions are higher-level functions provided by libraries. For example, fork() is a system call, and malloc() is a library function.

Answer 15: Paging in XV6 involves dividing physical memory into fixed-size blocks (pages) and mapping them to virtual memory. It provides benefits like process isolation, efficient use of physical memory, and simplifies memory management by allowing non-contiguous allocation. Paging enables demand paging, where pages are loaded into memory only when needed, reducing unnecessary memory usage.

Answer 16: Three essential shell commands in XV6 are:
          ls: Lists the contents of a directory.
          cd: Changes the current working directory.
          cp: Copies files or directories.

Answer 17: Process synchronization is crucial in XV6 to ensure proper coordination between concurrent processes. Mechanisms like locks and semaphores are used to prevent race conditions and maintain data integrity. Synchronization is essential to avoid conflicts and ensure that processes interact correctly, especially in a multi-process environment.

Answer 18: Interrupts in XV6 are signals generated by hardware or software events that require immediate attention. They are handled by interrupt service routines (ISRs), which are functions that respond to specific interrupts. Interrupts are significant as they allow the operating system to respond promptly to events like I/O completion or timer expiration without wasting CPU cycles continuously polling for events.

Answer 19: Virtual memory in XV6 is an abstraction that allows processes to use more memory than physically available. It is implemented using paging, where the virtual address space is divided into pages that may be stored in physical memory or on disk. Advantages include process isolation, efficient use of memory, and simplification of memory management.

Answer 20: The boot process involves the BIOS loading the bootloader from the disk, the bootloader loading the kernel into memory, and the kernel initializing the system. Specific steps include power-on self-test, BIOS initialization, bootloader execution, loading the kernel into memory, transitioning to protected mode, and finally, the kernel taking control and initializing the system.
